# revopoint-pop2-linux-info
linux related informations about RevoPoint Pop 2 

I'm one of the backers of the [RevoPoint Pop 2 kickstarter campain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2125914059/revopoint-pop2-high-precision-3d-scanner)
and asked for Linux support directly after backing _(the reply sounded like "We might look into it when the windows release is more stable")_
Of course I still hope this will happen officially one day, but I have the device since 2 months now and haven't done anything with it _(besides some quick tests on my wifes windows machine)_
because of missing Linux support, so today I was curious there are some news.

Haven't found anything official, but found this [forum thread](https://forum.revopoint3d.com/t/running-revo-scan-on-linux/11961)

I gave it a quick try and can confirm that using the software via wine _(actually I used proton)_ with the device connected via wifi seems to work just fine.
_(thanks for the hint, shyblower. in case you read this ðŸ˜€)_

But thats not all, as I found out something interesting on my own as well:
After connecting to the Pop 2 wifi, of course I was curious which ports are open on the device and therefore checked using

`map -T4 -A -v 192.168.179.1`

I was **very** excited when nmap returned port 22 - **ssh is open**:

```
`PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     Dropbear sshd 2019.78 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    lighttpd 1.4.41
```

After some obvious trial&error password attempts, I decided to try a bruteforce instead using nmap as well:

`nmap --script /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ssh-brute -p22  192.168.179.1  --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=passwords.txt`

where `users.txt` just contained `root` _(most embedded devices simply use Â´rootÂ´ as user, so I was assuming the Pop 2 does so as well)_

For the `password.txt` file I used `Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt` from the famous [SecLists repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

It didn't take long and the **root password** was found: **internet**

Not sure where to go from here, but I though maybe someone finds this interesting, so I created this repo :)
If there's something you'd like to know or have an idea what we can do, you're invited to open an issue.

I haven't done much with the rootfs yet _(mounted it via sshfs and copied it locally of course to start digging)_

Here are some random things which might be interesting _(might add more later_):

#
`/oem` and `/userdata` are writable

rootfs is rw remountable:
`mount -o remount,rw /`


# wild guess

stopping for now, but I'd guess that all required data are simply exported using lighttpd via cgi:

```
`# ls -la /tmp/webroot/cgi-bin
total 80
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   100 Jan  1 00:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   120 Jan  1 00:00 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 26220 Jan  1 00:00 zx_cmd.cgi
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 22072 Jan  1 00:00 zx_media.cgi
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 26148 Jan  1 00:00 zx_upload.cgi
```


the device has wlan0 and wlan1 devices.
 by default wlan1 opens the `POP2-REVO-XXXXXXXX` AP and wlan0 would connect to a `POP` AP
 
 ```
 # cat /data/wpa_supplicant.configO 
#pop2_enable=enable
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="POP"
        psk="12345678"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=CCMP TKIP 
        proto=WPA2 
}
```

(the functions in `/data/zx_start.sh` are not very clean, so not sure if wlan0 even is intended).
anyway you can simply edit `/data/wpa_supplicant.config` to join your own network.
_(haven't checked for too long, but it doesn't seem to try connect anything in the internet - of course better safe than sorry)_
